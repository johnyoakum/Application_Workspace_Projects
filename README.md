# Application_Workspace_Projects
This repo will be to store all my custom scripts I write for Application Workspace.

For all my scripts that use the powershell commands for Application Workspace, the account for use with the APIACCESS may need the following permissions:

1. API Access
2. View Connectors
3. Create Packages
4. View Packages
5. Modify Packages
6. Remove Packages
7. View Resources

You can create a custom Access Policy and assign it to the apiuser account that you create for this process.
