# Application_Workspace_Projects
This repo will be to store all my custom scripts I write for Application Workspace.

For all my scripts that use the powershell commands for Application Workspace, the account for use with the APIACCESS may need the following permissions:

1. API Access
2. View Connectors
3. Create Packages
4. View Packages
5. Modify Packages
6. Remove Packages
7. View Resources
8. View Devices
9. View Device Collections
10. Modify Device Collections
11. Create Device Collections

You can create a custom Access Policy and assign it to the apiuser account that you create for this process.
